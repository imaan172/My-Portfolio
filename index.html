                <p>I'm a 21-year-old coding enthusiast with a two-year love affair with Frontend Development. My coding journey has been a 
                  rollercoaster of challenges and victories, and every line of code is a testament to my passion for creating seamless digital 
                  experiences. When I'm not diving into the world of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript—occasionally wrestling with React—I'm either 
                  tackling my latest coding conquest or bothering my adorable fur babies. <br>
                  <br>
                  Outside the realm of pixels and code, you'll catch me exploring the wonders of Mother Nature or curled up with a good book. 
                  I have a soft spot for design, and while this portfolio might not fully showcase it, you can be sure that every project I 
                  undertake is a canvas for my creativity. If you share a love for coding, design, or just a good laugh, I'd love to connect and 
                  swap stories. Let's build something amazing together! </p>
